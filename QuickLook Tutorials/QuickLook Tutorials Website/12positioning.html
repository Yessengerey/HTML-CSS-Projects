	<h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
<hr />
<p>Good CSS cannot be achieved without proper HTML structure. So I'd even say that 
you have to keep in mind that you basically start writing CSS when you are building
up the structure of HTML. The first 'step' to "sensei-ing" CSS is to understand the
logic behind the CSS Box model and the Natural Page Flow (source order display of (X)HTML elements). 
Once you start to view the content of a web page as simply boxes of content, positioning 
and layout with CSS becomes very easy.</p>
<hr />

<h2>Floating</h2>
<p>In order to explain Floating of objects through CSS lets consider a real life
example. Let say we have three boxes of some content.</p>

<p class="examples">&lt;tag id=<strong>"box1"</strong>>...content...&lt;/tag><br />
&lt;tag id=<strong>"box2"</strong>>...content...&lt;/tag><br />
&lt;tag id=<strong>"box3"</strong>>...content...&lt;/tag><br /></p>

<p>All of them have certain and the same <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>. 
Let's change the <em>width</em> of the first box, say make it smaller, and <em>float</em> it to the left.
</p>

<p><span class="examples">#box1 {width: 200px; <strong>float: left;</strong>}</span> - What happens next?</p>

	<ol class="lists">
		<li>The box that had been assigned to float to the left will firstly be pushed to the
		top as far as possible, over the content of other boxes and to the opposite direction of
		the specified flow.</li>
		<li>Then the box is pushed in the direction of the float as far as possible</li>
		<li>As the floated box is now over the content of the other boxes, that content is
		allowed to wrap around the floated box. However the shape of boxes that remain 
		beneath the box1 do not change the shape.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Boxes that remain beneath another box after that box was floated can be pushed out from beneath the covering box,
	which is achieved by <strong>#box3 {clear: right/left/both;}</strong>. The values
	specify which side of the box should be cleared of floating elements.</p>	
	
	<p>Sometimes in order to tackle the problem with the content wrapping around the floated
	box, you could use <strong>columns</strong>. Which are simply created by padding the 
	content of the boxes that are beneath the floated box as well as altering the margins
	in order to move the borders of the boxes as well.</p>

<h2>Position Properties</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Value</th><th>Explanation</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>static</td><td>This value does not have a position and is set as a default</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>relative</td><td>Allows the element to be positioned 'relative' to the other elements, meaning change in the positioning of other elements may have an effect on the position of that element</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>absolute</td><td>With this value the element is being removed from the page flow and then be put anywhere you like</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>fixed</td><td>The element is being removed from the page flow and then fixed at the browser viewport, which allows the other content to be scrolled behind that element</td>
			</tr>
